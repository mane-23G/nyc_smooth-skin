                    How does Elite+ technology works to remove the facial discoloration?
                </p>
                <p className="answer">
                    The special wavelength selectively targets only blood in the tiny veins without affecting superficial skin or surrounding tissues making this the “gold standard” and safest treatment out there. The laser  uses selective light which likes blood inside your tiny veins. Once the light gets absorbed by the blood in the vein, it gets heated up causing the veins to shrink and eventually fade, leaving behind beautiful skin which you can show off!! No need to cover up with heavy makeup.
                    <br></br>
                    A gel will be applied to the areas of treatment.  This gel acts as a safety barrier between the laser and your skin. You will be given protective goggles to wear and you will feel as the laser hand piece is moving up and down your face or the nose.
