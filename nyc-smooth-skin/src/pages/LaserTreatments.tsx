            The Elite+ technology has a special wavelength that selectively targets only blood in the tiny veins without affecting superficial skin or surrounding tissues making this the “gold standard” and safest treatment out there. The laser  uses selective light which likes blood inside your tiny veins. Once the light gets absorbed by the blood in the vein, it gets heated up causing the veins to shrink and eventually fade, leaving behind beautiful skin which you can show off!! No need to cover up with heavy makeup.
